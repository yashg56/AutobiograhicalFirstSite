 <p>I am Yash Swarup Gupta. I am a 12 year old who lives in <strong>San Diego, California</strong>. I was born on June 28, 2004. I am a 7th grader at Pacific Trails Middle School. Three words to describe me is intelligent, curious, and clumsy. My hobbies include playing tennis and doing math. My favorite subjects are math, English, and science, particularly physics and chemistry. My parents are Rajesh and Neelam Gupta. My dad, Rajesh Gupta, is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Former Chair of Computer Science at University of California, San Diego(UCSD). My brothers are Hersh and Anand Gupta. Hersh Gupta is a freshman at Purdue University in West Layfatte, Indiana with a major in Chemical Engineering. Anand Gupta has a bachelor's degree in Molecular Biology and Cyber Security. My dreams are to attend MIT University.(Massachusetts Institute of Technology). I built this site using a programming language known as HTML.
