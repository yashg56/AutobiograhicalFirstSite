<p>Hello! Welcome to my Friends page! Friends are the basis of our personality. For example, is you have smart friends, it is proven that you will be smarter than with less intelligent people. Today, I am going to share a couple of my best friends.</p>
<ol>
<li>Chris - I have known Chris for a long time as he used to be my neighbor. Chris is a practical genius, especially when it comes to science. Chris loves playing video games and dislikes dancing and singing. Chris isn't very serious <strong>sometimes.</strong></li>
  <li>Hershey - I have known Hershey for 3 years now as he was my classmate. Hershey is a genius in almost everything except English. Hershey loves doing sports and dislikes writing. Hershey is clumsy <strong>from time to time</strong>.</li>
  <li>Rishi - I have known Rishi for as long as I can remember. Rishi is practically a genius, especially when it comes to hardware. Rishi loves playing video games and <strong>dislikes</strong> losing.
  <li>Yadav - Yadav and I have been best friends for as long as I can remember. Yadav is a god (in my opinon) at tennis and singing. Yadav loves trying new things and dislikes getting scared. Yadav is always curious.</li>
  <li>Anvay - Anvay has been my close friend for 3 years now. Anvay is a practical genius, especially when it comes to history and geography. Anvay loves playing Minecraft and dislikes English. Anvay is goofy <strong>sometimes.</strong></li>
